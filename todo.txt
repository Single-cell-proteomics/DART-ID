Run percolator on data
https://github.com/percolator/percolator/wiki/Interface
 * convert data into format the percolator likes
 * need msms.txt
 * write script to extract performance from percolator output
 * compare to existing methods

Compare to iRT
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.neu.edu/doi/10.1002/pmic.201100463/full

Could use the same principles of iRT - retention time is already normalized after the STAN alignment, and you can find common peptides between experiments, or by spiking in synthetic/labeled peptides.

Validate Input:
 * Correlation of RTs pairwise b/n experiments
 * Take only small subset to do correlation with
 * Web interface for this algorithm

Validation:
 * Fix positive bias in null distribution

FIT3 NOTES:

what to use for the P(RT|PSM is incorrect)? use the empirical RT distribution, or use a uniform distribution from 0 to max(RT-global), or 0 to max(RT-experiment)?

in the STAN fit, adjust the uniform based on which experiment it comes from?

Figure 1 - Method:
A: PEP vs PEP.new scatterplot
B: Fold Change Increase in IDs

Figure 2 - Validation:
A: Correlation matrix example for one protein
B: Original vs. New vs. Null


Supplemental Figures:

Filtering:
A: RT scatterplot b/n experiments
B: Correlation b/b all experiments

Alignment:

A: 1 on the 2 piece linear model - choose a couple of experiments
 - plot the fit and the residuals

B: 1 on the mixture model
 - pick a peptide-exp pair
 - rug the individual observations
 - plot densities on top of each other, alpha=0.5
 - illustrate how this effects updated PEP... which plot to use?
 - plot change in PEP vs. delta RT from the muijs


DONE:
