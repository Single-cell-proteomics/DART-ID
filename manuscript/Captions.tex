\def \suppmodel {{ \textbf{(a)}\; Let $\rho_{ijk}$ be the retention time for peptide $i$ in experiment $k$.  Initially the distribution of retention times across experiments may vary. To align the experiments we assume that there exists a set of \emph{canonical} retention times $\mu_i$ for all peptides and set of simple monotone increasing functions $f_k$, for each experiment $k$. $\epsilon$ is an error term expressing residual (unmodeled) variation in retention time.  As a first approximation, we assume that the observed retention times for any experiment can be well approximated using a two-segment linear regression model.\;\textbf{(b)}\; The distribution of the retention time of a PSM of peptide $i$ in experiment $k$ is modeled as a mixture model where $\lambda_{ijk}$ is the PEP for a given PSM, $\mu_{ijk}$ is the canonical retention time for a given PSM, and $\sigma_{i}$ is the standard deviation for that peptide. $\mu_{0}$ and $\sigma_{0}$ are the mean and standard deviation of the log density of all retention times, respectively.
